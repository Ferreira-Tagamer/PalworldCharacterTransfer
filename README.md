This script transfers character between worlds in Palworld, which allows friends to transfer their characters to each other's server without losing one's progress.

The script transfers the character and all its pals on your team and in your inventory, items on the character, and progress only and **does not transfer any map objects, items in chests from the original world, and pals working at your base. So move them into the inventory if you want them transferred along with you)**

This is best suited if you want to join your friend's world with your pals and progress

Running python char-export.py allows one to select source and target player saves and level.sav files to transfer all data of the player including level, items, and pals across.
The bugs mentioned in https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/19dhpjn/server_to_server_character_transfer_script/ such as transferred pals antagonizes the player, items do not have durability, and other issues have all been resolved

**Note: The player from the old world must be at least LV 2, and each player who wants to transfer their saves to a new world must first create a character in the new world, so that a target player save is present for transferring!**
